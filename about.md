As you may know, [__Geek & Tech Girls__](http://geekandtechgirls.github.io) is a non-profit asosiation which was born to attract women to technology and encourage girls to study and become geeks and developers. 

With this project we'd like to study our social network in _Facebook_ and _Twitter_ to measure our popularity between girls and the hours when we get more interactions. We're going to get data from our interactions on Twitter and Facebook and tag it with the sex (Male, Female or Unkown) of the profile the interaction came from. Once we have the data, we're going to export it and show it with interactive javascript graphs .
